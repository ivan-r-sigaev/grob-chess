A hobby chess engine written in **rust** (🦀🦀🦀), that is also *\*arguably\** **blasingly** (🔥🔥🔥) **fast** (🚀🚀🚀).

## Namesake

The engine is named after the [Grob Opening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grob%27s_Attack), which
in turn is named after the Swiss chess IM, [Henri Grob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Grob).

## ⚠️ Work In Progress ⚠️

The engine is currently being developed, so some features may be unstable or missing.

## Compiling And Testing
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ivan-r-sgiaev/grob-chess.git
cd grob-chess

# Run tests
cargo test

# Compile and run the engine
cargo run --release
```
