A chess engine written in rust (ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€), which is _arguably_ **blasingly** (ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥) **fast** (ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€).

## Namesake

The engine is named after the [Grob Opening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grob%27s_Attack), which
in turn is named after the Swiss chess IM, [Henri Grob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Grob).

## Work In Progress

This project is being actively developed, so some features may be unstable or 
not yet present.

## Compiling And Testing
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ivan-r-sgiaev/grob-chess.git
cd grob-chess

# Run tests
cargo test

# Compile and run the engine
cargo run --release
```
